Image classification and object detection tasks

Data in google drive: ping one of the contributors to get coordinates

### Notes

* download_data.py: Download images from google images. Usage: python download_data.py [search keyword] [num images to download] [target dir]

* Use gthumb for cropping, deleting images etc. This is an excellent lightweight tool for image editing.

* First trial: Download images for "ibm" and "red hat" and fine-tune a resnet model to classify images as one of these two categories. Notebook coming soon.
